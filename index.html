        Endless pride and great glory, honor and dignity, national treasure, the holy love for which people keep in
        their hearts throughout lives. People bow before it, swear allegiance to it, go into battle under it and die for
        it. Today, Azerbaijan celebrates the National Flag Day.

        The great symbol of the unity of the people - the tricolor flag, along with the anthem and emblem, is the
        official attribute of the statehood of Azerbaijan, and its history reflects the stages of development and change
        of homeland.

        Almost a month after the adoption of the Declaration of Independence and the proclamation of the Azerbaijan
        Democratic Republic, on June 21, 1918, the first decree was issued on the state flag of the ADR.

        However, this flag as a symbol of the ADR did not last long - on November 9, 1918, based on the report of Prime
        Minister Fatali Khan Khoysky, a draft national flag was approved - tricolor with horizontal stripes of blue, red
        and green with a white crescent and an eight-pointed star.

        A new state flag was hoisted above the parliament building on December 7, 1918.

        The first chairman of the ADR National Council, Mammad Emin Rasulzade, said in his speech at the parliamentary
        session that this tricolor banner, symbolizing independent Azerbaijan, raised by the National Council and
        signifying Turkic freedom, Islamic culture and modernity, will always fly over the country.</p>
